# Pseudo Columns

Pseudo columns are virtual columns present in each and every table but need to be explicitly called or referenced in SQL queries. These columns cannot be seen without explicitly calling them. üé≠

## Types of Pseudo Columns

### Rowid

- **Description**: Rowid is an 18-digit hexadecimal address that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It represents the physical address of a row in the database. üè∑Ô∏è
- **Example Usage**: `SELECT Rowid, Emp.* FROM Emp;` üöÄ
- **Key Points**:
  - Rowid is unique for each record.
  - It is automatically generated by the database system upon insertion of records.
  - Rowid cannot be directly inserted, updated, or deleted by users.
  - It is static in nature and remains constant unless the row is physically moved.
  - Rowid can be used to identify a record uniquely when there is no primary key or key attribute defined. üîë

#### Note

- Rowid is a useful way to delete records. üóëÔ∏è
- Rowid is unique and present for every record.
- Empty tables do not have Rowid.
- Rowid can be utilized to uniquely identify a record when there is no primary key or key attribute present in the table. üåü


### Rownum

- **Description**: Rownum acts as a sequential number assigned to each row in the result set. üö¶
- **Example Usage**: 
  ```sql
  SELECT Rownum, Emp.* FROM Emp;```
- **Key Points**:
  - Rownum is used for numbering the records in the resulting table.
  - It is dynamic in nature, meaning it changes with each execution.
  - Rownum is generated at the time of execution.
  - Rownum always starts with 1.
  - Rownum values cannot be duplicated.
  - Rownum gets incremented for each row it is assigned to. üî¢

# ROWID Usage

## Selecting Rows by ROWID

### Query 1: Selecting a Specific ROWID
```sql
-- Selecting a specific ROWID
SELECT ROWID, EMP.* FROM emp WHERE ROWID = '3';
```

### Query 2: Selecting ROWIDs Less Than or Equal to 10
```sql
-- Selecting ROWIDs less than or equal to 10
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE ROWID <= '10';
```

### Query 3: Selecting ROWIDs Greater Than 10
```sql
-- Selecting ROWIDs greater than 10
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE ROWID > '10';
```

### Query 4: Selecting a ROWID that Does Not Exist
```sql
-- SQL PLUS IN THIS QUERY OUTPUT IS NO ROW SELECTED
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE ROWID = '3';
```

## Making ROWNUM Static

### Query: Making ROWNUM Static and Aliasing as SLno
```sql
-- Making ROWNUM static and aliasing as SLno
SELECT 
    ROWNUM AS SLno, 
    emp.* 
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            empno, 
            ename, 
            job, 
            mgr, 
            hiredate, 
            sal, 
            comm, 
            deptno
        FROM 
            emp
        -- Add any conditions or sorting if needed
    ) emp;
```

### Note:
- The inner query retrieves the columns from the emp table.
- The ROWNUM pseudocolumn is aliased as SLno.
- Then, in the outer query, the columns from the inner query along with the aliased SLno column are selected.
- Now, you can use SLno as a separate static column name instead of ROWNUM. Make sure to adjust the query according to your specific requirements and add any conditions or sorting if needed.

## Using ROWID Instead of ROWNUM

### Query: Using ROWID as SLNO and Selecting Specific ROWIDs
```sql
-- Using ROWID instead of ROWNUM and selecting specific ROWIDs
SELECT * FROM (SELECT ROWID SLNO, EMP.* FROM EMP) WHERE SLNO = '3';
```

### Query: Using ROWID Instead of ROWNUM and Selecting Multiple ROWIDs
```sql
-- Using ROWID instead of ROWNUM and selecting multiple ROWIDs
SELECT * FROM (SELECT ROWID SLNO, EMP.* FROM EMP) WHERE SLNO IN (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);
```
